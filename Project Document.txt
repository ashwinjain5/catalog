About Project:
This project is related to catalog sharing and shortlisting.
How it works as of 17-Sep-2025 (only requirement portal, wholesale portal etc have been prepared until this date):
1. Add projects with image URLs and prices in the google sheet.
2. That sheet is broadcasted to public as JSON File
3. That JSON data is picked by the github pages server and showcased in frontend through this project repository.

Future Updates:
- Google sheet columns to be made in sync with standard Product/items table
- Each stakeholder to have their own catalog page vis-a-vis Kishore Mama, Gautam Mama, Amith Bhaiya, Dhariwal Retail etc.
